# OSS Sync

This directory contains the optional Aliyun OSS sync path for the generated
CardputerZero APT repository.

The normal publish path remains GitHub Pages. OSS sync is off by default and
only runs when explicitly enabled.

## What It Uploads

The workflow builds the APT repository into `public/`, then this sync uploads
the generated files to:

```text
oss://cardputer-zero-repo/packages/
```

That keeps the same path shape as the GitHub Pages URL:

```text
https://cardputerzero.github.io/packages/
```

When syncing to `oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com`, the script also generates an
AppStore registry for the China region at:

```text
https://cardputer-zero-repo.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/packages/cn/registry.json
```

The CN registry is generated from the OSS sync tree, so it can differ from the
default registry published at:

```text
https://cardputerzero.github.io/generated/registry.json
```

## Enable It

Manual run:

1. Run the `Deploy APT Repository to Pages` workflow.
2. Set `sync_oss` to `true`.

Automatic runs on `main` pushes:

1. Set repository variable `PACKAGES_OSS_SYNC_ENABLED` to `true`.
2. Keep the required OSS secrets configured.

## Required Secrets

```text
OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
```

## Optional Variables

```text
PACKAGES_OSS_ENDPOINT=oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com
PACKAGES_OSS_BUCKET=cardputer-zero-repo
PACKAGES_OSS_PREFIX=packages
PACKAGES_OSS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://cardputer-zero-repo.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com
```

`PACKAGES_OSS_PREFIX` may be empty if the repository should be uploaded at the
bucket root, but the default `packages` prefix avoids collisions with OS image
files and `os-list.json`.

`PACKAGES_OSS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is optional. If it is empty, the sync script uses
`https://${PACKAGES_OSS_BUCKET}.${PACKAGES_OSS_ENDPOINT}`.

## Per-Package Region Gate

Each package can opt out of the China OSS mirror in its `meta.json`:

```json
{
  "region": {
    "default": true,
    "CN": false
  }
}
```

When the target endpoint is `oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com`, packages with
`region.CN` set to `false` are removed from the temporary OSS sync tree before
upload. Their `.deb`, icon, screenshots, and metadata are not uploaded, and the
OSS-side APT index is rebuilt without those packages.

If `region` is missing, or `region.CN` is missing, the package is allowed to
sync by default. Other region keys are reserved for future mirrors.
